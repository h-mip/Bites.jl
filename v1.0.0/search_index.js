In64. \ninfection_ts The matrix time series of number of infected cases at each time step. A two-dimensional array of In64 with dimensions equal to number of repetitions and number of time steps.\nseed_cases Number of infected cases seeded into the population at the beginning of each repetition. If seed_cases=0, then the first cases will be detected in the data.
